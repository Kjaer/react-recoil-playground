# React-Recoil PLayground

> âœ¨ Bootstrapped with Create Snowpack App (CSA).

I am developing a small but scalable React.js application. The intention is playing with Recoil.
on the otherside, refreshing some css knowledge as well like grids. In order to accomplish these goals. I am gonna keep
track of todo list 

## Achievements

- [ ] Develop small but scalable React app
- [ ] Integrate Recoil and expose every feature (this todo going to expand when I discover)
- [ ] Use latest CSS techniques
    - [ ] CSS Grids for layout 
- [ ] Go through HTML5 tags and find use cases for rare-used tags

## Available Scripts

### npm start

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open http://localhost:8080 to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### npm test

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about running tests for more information.

### npm run build

Builds a static copy of your site to the `build/` folder.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

**For the best production performance:** Add a build bundler plugin like "@snowpack/plugin-webpack" or "@snowpack/plugin-parcel" to your `snowpack.config.json` config file.
